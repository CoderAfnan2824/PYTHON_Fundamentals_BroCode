# Numpy Array is similar to Java Array
# It is fixed in size and contains same type elements

'''
NumPy, short for Numerical Python, is a fundamental library for numerical and scientific computing in Python.
NumPy serves as the foundation for many data science and machine learning libraries, making it an essential tool for data analysis and scientific research in Python.
